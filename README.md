## Overview

Implementation of Horizon-GS, a novel approach built upon Gaussian Splatting techniques, tackles the unified reconstruction and rendering for aerial and street views. Horizon-GS addresses the key challenges of combining these perspectives with a new training strategy, overcoming viewpoint discrepancies to generate high-fidelity scenes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/city-super/Horizon-GS.git --recursive
cd Horizon-GS
```

2. Install dependencies

```
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate horizon_gs
```

Here we use [gsplat](https://docs.gsplat.studio/main/) to unify the rendering process of different Gaussians. Considering the adaptation for 2D-GS, we choose [gsplat version](https://github.com/FantasticOven2/gsplat.git) which supports 2DGS.

## Data

First, create a ```data/``` folder inside the project path by 

```
mkdir data
```

Next, download the following data, and place them under a desired direcory, e.g. data/:

- The HorizonGS data is available in [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoDai/HorizonGS).
- The UCGS dataset are provided by the paper author [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjSB7GqORz5rUvB3KaAMIiGwX1mtmRjb/view). 
- The MatrixCity dataset can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoDai/MatrixCity/tree/main)/[Openxlab](https://openxlab.org.cn/datasets/bdaibdai/MatrixCity)/[百度网盘[提取码:hqnn]](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=87P0e5p1hz9t5mgdJXjL1g). 

## 🚀 TODO & Roadmap

- [x] Release Code and Dataset 🎉
- [ ] Support distributed training


## Training

For training a small scene like Block_small, first generate the config and then run it:

```
# generate config, we have provided the config for all datasets in the config folder
python preprocess/data_preprocess.py --config config/<dataset>/config.yaml

# train coarse
python train.py --config config/<dataset>/coarse.yaml

# train fine
python train.py --config config/<dataset>/fine.yaml
```

For training a large scene like Block_A, first generate the config and then run it:

```
# generate config
python preprocess/data_preprocess.py --config config/<dataset>/config.yaml

# train coarse of each chunk
python train.py --config config/<dataset>/coarse.yaml

# train fine of each chunk
python train.py --config config/<dataset>/fine.yaml

# merge all chunks
python merge.py -m <path to trained model> --config config/<dataset>/config.yaml
```

## Evaluation

We keep the manual rendering function with a similar usage of the counterpart in [3D-GS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), one can run it by 

```
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
python export_mesh.py -m <path to trained model> # Export mesh
```
